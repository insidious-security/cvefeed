## How to use:
### 1. Create a Virtual Environment:   
It's good practice to use a virtual environment for Python projects to keep dependencies isolated.
```bash
$ python -m venv cve
$ source cve/bin/activate
```

### 2. Install Dependencies:
With the virtual environment activated, install the required Python packages:
```bash
$ pip install rich requests
```

### Run the program:
```bash
$ python cvefeed.py
```
